Mathematics Library for Java

The mathIT mathematics library provides classes and methods for direct use in Javaâ„¢. It covers the mathematical areas of algebra, number theory, approximation theory, statistics, and graph theory, but also provides methods to plot function graphs, to parse functions from strings (in usual infix and prefix notation), to implement quantum registers and quantum algorithms, or to use the genetic code.

The library documentation can be found at
